# CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOREX MARKET
OUR MISSIONS HERE IS TO ANALYSE GLOBAL WARMING EFFECTS ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET (AN EVIDENCE FROM EUROPEAN, SOUTH AFRICAN, CHILEAN, AND AUSTRALIAN FOREX MARKETS)

 The effects of climate change, extreme heat or global warming on the foreign exchange
 market has received little attention in the literature. Early studies on the subject, such
 as Glassman (1987), Boothe (1988) concentrated on the own statistical properties of
 the spread. Only recently, researchers attempted to offer empirical as well as theoretical
 analyses of extreme heat effects on stock market activity. These studies include Goodhart
 (1990)...“Prior research on behavioral finance tends to show that investor’s financial
 decisions are not only the result of purely rational rules but are also subject to cognitive
 and emotional biases”. Studies shares the assumption that external factors such as weather
 conditions influence both individuals and collective moods Makridis and Schloetzer (2023).
 However, we know about impacts of temperature on investors financial investors. Cao and
 Wei (2005) observe a negative relationship between temperature and stock returns. Cha
 et al. (2021) observe that real exchange rate is more likely to depreciate if the country
 is warmer, wealthier, more dependent on agriculture, less open and more dependent on
 tourism. Our study contribute directly to this strand of literature by isolating the specific
 influence of ENSO on the financial decisions of market agents. Moreover in contrast to
 prior studies that mainly examine the effect of weather conditions returns and volatility,
 our analysis focuses on Foreign exchange volume. We posit that Forex volume is a more
 appropriate measure of country currencies activity.
